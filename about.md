So this is the part where I describe myself, no? I'm in Brooklyn right now, currently working as an SEO consultant. But the truth is, I've really come to love front-end development, web design and what can be considered a very adolescent understanding of programming. Having realized this, I've been spent the last two years of my life researching and developing this knowledge and hope to share bits and pieces of that here.
