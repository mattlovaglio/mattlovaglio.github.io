**Matt Lovaglio** is a Brooklyn based lover-of-technology. He began work in search engine marketing, but his curiosity for the more technical side of things soon took over. Once he was able to say that *Text Editors* were exciting to use, it was clearly time to tumble down the rabbit hole.

He is currently working on a productivity Mac/iOS App for digital designers and developers.
