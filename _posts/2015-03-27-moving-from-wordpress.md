title: Moving From WordPress
---
## A Quick Note

I recently decided that it was time to move away from WordPress. I think it's really great software and has an amazing community behind it. But as my understanding of web technologies grew to a more advanced level, I was beginning to see the subtle quirks that made WordPress a less suitable choice for me.

### Here are a few reasons:

* Extensibility is bound by the platform's ecosystem. Generally speaking.
* Making themes, despite there being boilerplates, starting points and online resources readily available, was just not pleasurable for me.
* Performance Quirks.
* Tooling workflows were not available. Or at least using them in this context felt ridiculous.
* Bloated source code.
* Specific hosting requirements. Plus hosting cost.
* Not easy to back-up.

I wanted to continue blogging and maintain a high level of control over my site, which is why something like Jekyll made sense.

###This blog:

This particular blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I've altered a few things, but for the most part it's "themed", much like a WordPress theme but not nearly as restricting. The theme that's being used is called [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), which is actually an official theme built by the maker of Poole, [@mdo](http://markdotto.com). He also happens to be the dude that made [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

As for the back end of things, posts are written in Markdown. And there is essentially no GUI. For someone used to a GUI back end, it might seem a bit involved. Learning how to use Jekyll requires some lite terminal usage, learning aspects about the liquid templating language, Markdown and a base knowledge of HTML & CSS. But if you can get past that (it's not difficult, trust me), you will be pleasantly surprised by what you can do.

Also, if you're worried about any tools that you'll need to purchase, you really just need a decent text editor. I recommend GitHub's [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io). Other than that, you'll use the terminal (or Windows equivalent), git, the GitHub app (Mac and Windows) and a browser. All of which are in fact, free.

I'll probably write some articles on this in the near future.

I recommend that you look into Jekyll. Oh I almost forgot to mention that you can host your site for free, using GitHub Pages.
