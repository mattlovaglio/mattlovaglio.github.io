# The personal website for Matt Lovaglio
This is the 2019 issue of my personal website, after a significant rebrand. I have moved on to practicing Technical SEO. The content found on this blog will reflect this change. 

## Changes moving forward
For the time being, the website uses Jekyll's default theme: Minima. I will make iterative changes to accommodate a better user experience.

Behind the scenes, I'm building my own Gem-Based Jekyll theme. But until then, I want to disseminate useful content to the SEO community.
